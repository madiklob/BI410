# 1. Introduction

## Objectives
- Understand the benefits of an automated version control system.
- Understand the basics of how automated version control systems work.

We'll start by exploring how version control can be used
to keep track of what one person did and when.
Even if you aren't collaborating with other people,
automated version control is much better than this situation:

!["notFinal.doc" by Jorge Cham, <https://www.phdcomics.com>](fig/phd101212s.png){alt='Comic: a PhD student sends "FINAL.doc" to their supervisor, but after several increasingly intense and frustrating rounds of comments and revisions they end up with a file named "FINAL_rev.22.comments49.corrections.10.#@$%WHYDIDCOMETOGRADSCHOOL????.doc"'}

We've all been in this situation before: it seems unnecessary to have
multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word
processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft
Word's
[Track Changes](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Track-changes-in-Word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a),
Google Docs' [version history](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en), or
LibreOffice's [Recording and Displaying Changes](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Recording_and_Displaying_Changes).

Version control systems start with a base version of the document and
then record changes you make each step of the way. You can
think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base
document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your
more recent version.

![](fig/play-changes.svg){alt='Changes Are Saved Sequentially'}

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you
can then think about "playing back" different sets of changes on the base document, ultimately
resulting in different versions of that document. For example, two users can make independent
sets of changes on the same document.

![](fig/versions.svg){alt='Different Versions Can be Saved'}

Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a 
conflict - you can
incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.

![](fig/merge.svg){alt='Multiple Versions Can be Merged'}

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us,
effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide
which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is
called a [commit](../learners/reference.md#commit)), and keeps useful metadata
about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their
metadata make up a [repository](../learners/reference.md#repository).
Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating
collaboration among different people.

# Hypothetical: Paper Writing

- Imagine you drafted an excellent paragraph for a paper you are writing, but later ruin
  it. How would you retrieve the *excellent* version of your conclusion? Is it even possible?

- Imagine you have 5 co-authors. How would you manage the changes and comments
  they make to your paper?  If you use LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word, what happens if
  you accept changes made using the `Track Changes` option? Do you have a
  history of those changes?


# Solution

- Recovering the excellent version is only possible if you created a copy
  of the old version of the paper. The danger of losing good versions
  often leads to the problematic workflow illustrated in the PhD Comics
  cartoon at the top of this page.

- Collaborative writing with traditional word processors is cumbersome.
  Either every collaborator has to work on a document sequentially
  (slowing down the process of writing), or you have to send out a
  version to all collaborators and manually merge their comments into
  your document. The 'track changes' or 'record changes' option can
  highlight changes for you and simplifies merging, but as soon as you
  accept changes you will lose their history. You will then no longer
  know who suggested that change, why it was suggested, or when it was
  merged into the rest of the document. Even online word processors like
  Google Docs or Microsoft Office Online do not fully resolve these
  problems.
  
  
- Version control is like an unlimited 'undo'.
- Version control also allows many people to work in parallel.

# Good/conventional commit messages
Commit messages should start with a "tag" of what type of commit is it (see below), than a brief (\<50 characters) statement about the
changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will" <commit message here>.
If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes. Use this additional space to 
explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be.

Feat– feature

Fix– bug fixes

Docs– changes to the documentation like README

Style– style or formatting change 

Perf – improves code performance

Test– test a feature

# Staging Area

If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project,
`git add` specifies *what* will go in a snapshot
(putting things in the staging area),
and `git commit` then *actually takes* the snapshot, and
makes a permanent record of it (as a commit).
If you don't have anything staged when you type `git commit`,
Git will prompt you to use `git commit -a` or `git commit --all`,
which is kind of like gathering *everyone* to take a group photo!
However, it's almost always better to
explicitly add things to the staging area, because you might
commit changes you forgot you made. (Going back to the group photo simile,
you might get an extra with incomplete makeup walking on
the stage for the picture because you used `-a`!)
Try to stage things manually,
or you might find yourself searching for "git undo commit" more
than you would like!

![The Git Staging Area](fig/git-staging-area.svg)

To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (`git commit`):

# Exploring History

## Objectives
- Explain what the HEAD of a repository is and how to use it.
- Identify and use Git commit numbers.
- Compare various versions of tracked files.
- Restore old versions of files.


You can refer to the *most recent commit* of the working
directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`;
we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation,
so `HEAD~1`
means "the previous commit",
while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using
those long strings of digits and letters
that `git log` displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and "unique" really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any computer
has a unique 40-character identifier.
Our first commit was given the ID
`f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b`,
so let's try this:

It's important to remember that
we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository
*before* the change we're trying to undo.
A common mistake is to use the number of
the commit in which we made the change we're trying to discard.
In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from before the most
recent commit (`HEAD~1`), which is commit `f22b25e`:

![](fig/git-checkout.svg){alt='Git Checkout'}

So, to put it all together,
here's how Git works in cartoon form:

![https://figshare.com/articles/How_Git_works_a_cartoon/1328266](fig/git_staging.svg)


The fact that files can be reverted one by one
tends to change the way people organize their work.
If everything is in one large document,
it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction
without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion.
If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files,
on the other hand,
moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.


# Github

Version control really comes into its own when we begin to collaborate with
other people.  We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the
only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.

Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories.  In
practice, though, it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it
on the web rather than on someone's laptop.  Most programmers use hosting
services like [GitHub](https://github.com) to hold those main copies.

Now that we have two (local and on github) repositories, we need a diagram like this:

![](fig/git-freshly-made-github-repo.svg){alt='Freshly-Made GitHub Repository'}

Note that our local repository still contains our earlier work on, but the
remote repository on GitHub appears empty as it doesn't contain any files yet.

Once we push, our local and remote repositories are now in this state:

# Question 1 

- Create a git repo for the problem sets for the rest of the quarter. Call it ds-environ-[your initials] on your computer. 
- Create another git repo for your final project (give it a name related to your project) on your computer. 
- Create a readme file to each repo and commit your changes. 
- Connect local to remote repository on github. 
- Add Nicole (nmartinez14) and I (lponisio) as collaborators to both repos on github.
- Congratulations! You are all set up to start version controlling your project :) For the rest of the course, you will turn your your lab problem sets on github (and also upload a pdf to canvas).
