# 1. Introduction 

## Objectives
- Describe the fundamental attributes of a raster dataset.
- Explore raster attributes and metadata using R.
- Import rasters into R using the `terra` package.
- Plot a raster file in R using the `ggplot2` package.
- Describe the difference between single- and multi-band rasters.

We will introduce the fundamental principles, packages and
metadata/raster attributes that are needed to work with raster data in R. We will
discuss some of the core metadata elements that we need to understand to work with
rasters in R, including CRS and resolution. We will also explore missing and bad
data values as stored in a raster and how R handles these elements.

## About Raster Data

Raster data is any pixelated (or gridded) data where each pixel is associated
with a specific geographical location. The value of a pixel can be
continuous (e.g. elevation) or categorical (e.g. land use). If this sounds
familiar, it is because this data structure is very common: it's how
we represent any digital image. A geospatial raster is only different
from a digital photo in that it is accompanied by spatial information
that connects the data to a particular location. This includes the
raster's extent and cell size, the number of rows and columns, and
its coordinate reference system (or CRS).

## Continuous rasters
Some examples of continuous rasters include:

1. Precipitation maps.
2. Maps of tree height derived from LiDAR data.
3. Elevation values for a region.

## Categorial rasters
Some rasters contain categorical data where each pixel represents a discrete
class such as a landcover type (e.g., "forest" or "grassland") rather than a
continuous value such as elevation or temperature. Some examples of classified
maps include:

1. Landcover / land-use maps.
2. Tree height maps classified as short, medium, and tall trees.
3. Elevation maps classified as low, medium, and high elevation.

# 2. Reading in raster data and understanding its attributes 

## The Data
The data  was collected by [National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)](https://www.neonscience.org/). 
The data uses data from Harvard Forest (HARV) - Massachusetts, USA - [fieldsite description](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/harv)

## View Raster File Attributes

We will be working with a series of GeoTIFF files. The
GeoTIFF format contains a set of embedded tags with metadata about the raster
data. We can use the function `describe()` to get information about our raster
data before we read that data into R. It is ideal to do this before importing
your data.

We will be using the digital elevation model (DSM) data from the forest

```{r view-attributes-gdal}
describe("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")
```

If you wish to store this information in R, you can do the following:

```{r}
HARV_dsmCrop_info <- capture.output(
  describe("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")
)
```

Each line of text that was printed to the console is now stored as an element of
the character vector `HARV_dsmCrop_info`. We will be exploring this data throughout this
demo. By the end of this demo, you will be able to explain and understand the output above.

## BP programming tip - Object names

To improve code readability, file and object names should be used that make it clear what is in
the file. The data for this demo were collected from Harvard Forest so
we'll use a naming convention of `datatype_HARV`.

## Open a Raster in R
Now that we've previewed the metadata for our GeoTIFF, let's import this
raster dataset into R and explore its metadata more closely. We can use the `rast()`
function to open a raster in R.

```{r}
DSM_HARV <-
  rast("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")

DSM_HARV
```

The information above includes a report of min and max values, but no other data
range statistics. Similar to other R data structures like vectors and data frame
columns, descriptive statistics for raster data can be retrieved like

```{r}
summary(DSM_HARV)
```

but note the warning - unless you force R to calculate these statistics using
every cell in the raster, it will take a random sample of 100,000 cells and
calculate from that instead. To force calculation all the values, you can use 
the function `values`:

```{r}
summary(values(DSM_HARV))
```

To visualise this data in R using `ggplot2`, we need to convert it to a
dataframe.  The `terra` package has an built-in function for conversion to a plot-able dataframe. We need to tell R that the data is geo-referenced using the argument xy=TRUE.

```{r}
DSM_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(DSM_HARV, xy = TRUE)
```

Now when we view the structure of our data, we will see a standard
dataframe format.

```{r}
str(DSM_HARV_df)
```

We can use `ggplot()` to plot this data. 
- We will set the color scale to  `scale_fill_viridis_c` which is a color-blindness friendly color scale. 

```{r ggplot-raster, fig.cap="Raster plot with ggplot2 using the viridis color scale"}

ggplot() +
    geom_raster(data = DSM_HARV_df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_dsmCrop)) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c() 
```

## Plotting Tip

More information about the Viridis palette used above at
[R Viridis package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html).

## What do we see? 
This map shows the digital surface model, so the elevation of the surface of our study site in Harvard Forest. From the legend, we can see that the maximum elevation is ~400, but we can't tell whether this is 400 feet or 400 meters because the legend doesn't show us the units. We
can look at the metadata of our object to see what the units are. Much of the
metadata that we're interested in is part of the Coordinate Reference System (CRS). 

Now we will see how features of the CRS appear in our data file and what
meanings they have.

### Raster Coordinate Reference System (CRS) 

We can view the CRS string associated with our R object using the`crs()`
function.

```{r view-resolution-units}
crs(DSM_HARV, proj = TRUE)
```


What units are our data in?
`+units=m` tells us that our data is in meters.

## Understanding CRS in Proj4 Format

The CRS for our data is given to us by R in `proj4` format. Let's break down
the pieces of `proj4` string. The string contains all of the individual CRS
elements that R or another GIS might need. Each element is specified with a
`+` sign, similar to how a `.csv` file is delimited or broken up by a `,`. After
each `+` we see the CRS element being defined. For example projection (`proj=`)
and datum (`datum=`).

### UTM Proj4 String

A projection string (like the one of `DSM_HARV`) specifies the UTM projection 
as follows:

`+proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs'



- **proj=utm:** the projection is UTM, UTM has several zones.
- **zone=18:** the zone is 18
- **datum=WGS84:** the datum is WGS84 (the datum refers to the  0,0 reference for
  the coordinate system used in the projection)
- **units=m:** the units for the coordinates are in meters

Sometimes you will also see
+ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0`

- **ellps=WGS84:** the ellipsoid (how the earth's  roundness is calculated) for
  the data is WGS84 (not in our crs above, but it can be.)
- **+towgs84=0,0,0**  parameter shifts (translation + rotation + scaling) realted to the datum

Note that the zone is unique to the UTM projection. Not all CRSs will have a
zone. Image source: Chrismurf at English Wikipedia, via [Wikimedia Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system#/media/File:Utm-zones-USA.svg) (CC-BY).

## Extent

The spatial extent is the geographic area that the raster data covers.
The spatial extent of an R spatial object represents the geographic edge or
location that is the furthest north, south, east and west. In other words, extent
represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object.

![](fig/dc-spatial-raster/spatial_extent.png){alt='Spatial extent image'}

{: .text-center}

```{r}
ext(DSM_HARV)
```

## Resolution

A resolution of a raster represents the area on the ground that each
pixel of the raster covers. The image below illustrates the effect
of changes in resolution.

![](fig/dc-spatial-raster/raster_resolution.png){alt='Resolution image'}

(Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON))
{: .text-center}

```{r}
res(DSM_HARV)
```

## Raster Bands

The Digital Surface Model object (`DSM_HARV`) that we've been working with is a
single band raster. This means that there is only one dataset stored in the
raster: surface elevation in meters for one time period.

![](fig/dc-spatial-raster/single_multi_raster.png){alt='Multi-band raster image'}

A raster dataset can contain one or more bands. We can use the `rast()`
function to import one single band from a single or multi-band raster. We can
view the number of bands in a raster using the `nly()` function.

```{r view-raster-bands}
nlyr(DSM_HARV)
```

However, raster data can also be multi-band, meaning that one raster file
contains data for more than one variable or time period for each cell. By
default the `raster()` function only imports the first band in a raster
regardless of whether it has one or more bands. 

## Calculate Raster Min and Max Values

It is useful to know the minimum or maximum values of a raster dataset. In this
case, given we are working with elevation data, these values represent the
min/max elevation range at our site.

Raster statistics are often calculated and embedded in a GeoTIFF for us. We
can view these values:

We can see that the elevation at our site ranges from `r min(terra::values(DSM_HARV))`m to
`r max(terra::values(DSM_HARV))`m.


```{r view-min-max}
minmax(DSM_HARV)

min(values(DSM_HARV))

max(values(DSM_HARV))
```
# 3. "Classifying" a raster

## Binning Raster Data and Plotting Binned data

Above, we viewed our data using a continuous color ramp. For
clarity and visibility of the plot, we may prefer to view the data in discrete bins or
colored according to ranges of values. This is comparable to a "classified"
map. To do this, we need to tell `ggplot` how many groups to break our data 
into, and where those breaks should be. To make these decisions, it is useful 
to first explore the distribution of the data using a bar plot. To begin with, 
we will use `dplyr`'s `mutate()` function combined with `cut()` to split the 
data into 3 bins.

We want to set cutoff values for these groups to have the elevation ranges of
301–350 m, 351–400 m, and 401–450 m.
To implement this we will give `mutate()` a numeric vector of break points 
instead of the number of breaks we want.

```{r custom-bins}
custom_bins <- c(300, 350, 400, 450)

DSM_HARV_df <- DSM_HARV_df %>%
  mutate(fct_elevation_2 = cut(HARV_dsmCrop, breaks = custom_bins))

unique(DSM_HARV_df$fct_elevation_2)
```

We can use those groups to plot our raster data, with each group being a 
different color:

```{r raster-with-breaks}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = DSM_HARV_df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = fct_elevation_2)) 
```

The plot above uses the default colors inside `ggplot` for raster objects.
We can specify our own colors to make the plot look a little nicer.
R has a built in set of colors for plotting terrain, which are built in
to the `terrain.colors()` function.
Since we have three bins, we want to create a 3-color palette:

```{r terrain-colors}
terrain.colors(3)
```

The `terrain.colors()` function returns *hex colors* -
each of these character strings represents a color.
To use these in our map, we pass them across using the
`scale_fill_manual()` function.

```{r ggplot-breaks-customcolors}

ggplot() +
 geom_raster(data = DSM_HARV_df , aes(x = x, y = y,
                                      fill = fct_elevation_2)) + 
    scale_fill_manual(values = terrain.colors(3)) 
```

## 5. Layering Rasters

We can layer a raster on top of a hillshade raster for the same area, and use a transparency factor to create a 3-dimensional shaded effect. 

The **hillshade layer** maps the terrain using light and shadow to create a 
3D-looking image, based on a **hypothetical illumination of the ground level**.A
hillshade is a raster that maps the shadows and texture that you would see from
above when viewing terrain. We will add a custom color, making the plot grey.

First we need to read in our DSM hillshade data and view the structure:

```{r}
DSM_hill_HARV <-
  rast("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_DSMhill.tif")

DSM_hill_HARV
```

Next we convert it to a dataframe, so that we can plot it using `ggplot2`:

```{r}
DSM_hill_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(DSM_hill_HARV, xy = TRUE) 

str(DSM_hill_HARV_df)
```

Now we can plot the hillshade data:

```{r raster-hillshade}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = DSM_hill_HARV_df,
              aes(x = x, y = y, alpha = HARV_DSMhill)) + 
  scale_alpha(range =  c(0.15, 0.65), guide = "none") 
```

We can layer another raster on top of our hillshade by adding another call to
the `geom_raster()` function. Let's overlay `DSM_HARV` on top of the `hill_HARV`.

```{r overlay-hillshade}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = DSM_HARV_df , 
              aes(x = x, y = y, 
                  fill = HARV_dsmCrop)) + 
  geom_raster(data = DSM_hill_HARV_df, 
              aes(x = x, y = y, 
                  alpha = HARV_DSMhill)) +  
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +  
  scale_alpha(range = c(0.15, 0.65), guide = "none") +  
  ggtitle("Elevation with hillshade") 
```

# 6. Reprojection

Sometimes we encounter raster datasets that do not "line up" when plotted or
analyzed. Rasters that don't line up are most often in different Coordinate
Reference Systems (CRS).  We will work through how to deal with rasters in 
different, known CRSs. It will walk though reprojecting rasters in R using 
the `project()` function in the `terra` package.

## Raster Projection in R

We will read in the Harvard Forest Digital Terrain
Model data. This differs from the surface model data we've been working with so
far in that the digital surface model (DSM) includes the tops of trees, while
the digital terrain model (DTM) shows the ground level.

Here, we will create a map of the Harvard ForestDigital Terrain Model (`DTM_HARV`)  layered on top of the hillshade 
(`DTM_hill_HARV`).

First, we need to import the DTM and DTM hillshade data.

```{r import-DTM-hillshade}
DTM_HARV <- 
    rast("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif")

DTM_hill_HARV <- 
    rast("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_DTMhill_WGS84.tif")
```

Next, we will convert each of these datasets to a dataframe for
plotting with `ggplot`.

```{r}
DTM_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(DTM_HARV, xy = TRUE)

DTM_hill_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(DTM_hill_HARV, xy = TRUE)
```

Now we can create a map of the DTM layered over the hillshade.

```{r}
ggplot() +
     geom_raster(data = DTM_HARV_df , 
                 aes(x = x, y = y, 
                  fill = HARV_dtmCrop)) + 
     geom_raster(data = DTM_hill_HARV_df, 
                 aes(x = x, y = y, 
                   alpha = HARV_DTMhill_WGS84)) +
     scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Elevation", colors = terrain.colors(10)) 
```

Our results are curious - neither the Digital Terrain Model (`DTM_HARV_df`)
nor the DTM Hillshade (`DTM_hill_HARV_df`) plotted.
Let's try to plot the DTM on its own to make sure there are data there.

```{r plot-DTM}
ggplot() +
geom_raster(data = DTM_HARV_df,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
    fill = HARV_dtmCrop)) +
scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Elevation", colors = terrain.colors(10))
```

Our DTM seems to contain data and plots just fine.

Next we plot the DTM Hillshade on its own to see whether everything is OK.

```{r plot-DTM-hill}
ggplot() +
geom_raster(data = DTM_hill_HARV_df,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
    alpha = HARV_DTMhill_WGS84))
```

If we look at the axes, we can see that the projections of the two rasters are 
different.
When this is the case, `ggplot` won't render the image. It won't even throw an 
error message to tell you something has gone wrong. We can look at Coordinate 
Reference Systems (CRSs) of the DTM and the hillshade data to see how they 
differ.

```{r explore-crs}
# view crs for DTM
crs(DTM_HARV, parse = TRUE, proj = TRUE)

# view crs for hillshade
crs(DTM_hill_HARV, parse = TRUE, proj = TRUE)

# One is in UTM one is in longlat, need them to match 
```

`DTM_HARV` is in the UTM projection, with units of meters.
`DTM_hill_HARV` is in
`Geographic WGS84` - which is represented by latitude and longitude values.

Because the two rasters are in different CRSs, they don't line up when plotted
in R. We need to reproject (or change the projection of) `DTM_hill_HARV` into 
the UTM CRS. Alternatively, we could reproject `DTM_HARV` into WGS84.

## Reproject Rasters

We can use the `project()` function to reproject a raster into a new CRS.
Keep in mind that reprojection only works when you first have a defined CRS
for the raster object that you want to reproject. It cannot be used if no
CRS is defined. Lucky for us, the `DTM_hill_HARV` has a defined CRS.

When we reproject a raster, we move it from one "grid" to another. Thus, we are 
modifying the data! Keep this in mind as we work with raster data.

To use the `project()` function, we need to define two things:

1. the object we want to reproject and
2. the CRS that we want to reproject it to.

The syntax is `project(RasterObject, crs)`

We want the CRS of our hillshade to match the `DTM_HARV` raster. We can thus
assign the CRS of our `DTM_HARV` to our hillshade within the `project()`
function as follows: `crs(DTM_HARV)`.
Note that we are using the `project()` function on the raster object,
not the `data.frame()` we use for plotting with `ggplot`.

First we will reproject our `DTM_hill_HARV` raster data to match the `DTM_HARV` 
raster CRS:

```{r reproject-raster}
DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV <- project(DTM_hill_HARV,
                                 crs(DTM_HARV))
```

Now we can compare the CRS of our original DTM hillshade and our new DTM 
hillshade, to see how they are different.

```{r}
crs(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV, parse = TRUE, proj=TRUE)
crs(DTM_HARV, parse = TRUE, proj=TRUE)
```

We can also compare the extent of the two objects.

```{r}
ext(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV)
ext(DTM_hill_HARV)
```

Notice in the output above that the `crs()` of `DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV` is now
UTM. However, the extent values of `DTM_hillUTMZ18N_HARV` are different from
`DTM_hill_HARV`.

## Discussion: Extent Change with CRS Change

Why do you think the two extents differ?

## Answers

The extent for DTM\_hill\_UTMZ18N\_HARV is in UTMs so the extent is in meters. 
The extent for DTM\_hill\_HARV is in lat/long so the extent is expressed in 
decimal degrees.

## Deal with Raster Resolution

Let's next have a look at the resolution of our reprojected hillshade versus 
our original data.

```{r view-resolution}
res(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV)
res(DTM_HARV)
```

These two resolutions are different, but they're representing the same data. We 
can tell R to force our newly reprojected raster to be 1m x 1m resolution by 
adding a line of code `res=1` within the `project()` function. In the 
example below, we ensure a resolution match by using `res(DTM_HARV)` as a 
variable.

```{r reproject-assign-resolution}
  DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV <- project(DTM_hill_HARV, 
                                   crs(DTM_HARV), 
                                   res = res(DTM_HARV)) 
```

Now both our resolutions and our CRSs match, so we can plot these two data sets 
together. Let's double-check our resolution to be sure:

```{r}
res(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV)
res(DTM_HARV)
```

For plotting with `ggplot()`, we will need to create a dataframe from our newly 
reprojected raster.

```{r make-df-projected-raster}
DTM_hill_HARV_2_df <- as.data.frame(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV, xy = TRUE)
```

We can now create a plot of this data.

```{r plot-projected-raster}
ggplot() +
     geom_raster(data = DTM_HARV_df , 
                 aes(x = x, y = y, 
                  fill = HARV_dtmCrop)) + 
     geom_raster(data = DTM_hill_HARV_2_df, 
                 aes(x = x, y = y, 
                   alpha = HARV_DTMhill_WGS84)) +
     scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Elevation", colors = terrain.colors(10))
```

We have now successfully draped the Digital Terrain Model on top of our
hillshade to produce a nice looking, textured map!

## Summary
- In order to plot two raster data sets together, they must be in the same CRS.
- Use the `project()` function to convert between CRSs.


# OPTIONAL. Dealing with Missing Data

Raster data often has a `NoDataValue` associated with it. This is a value
assigned to pixels where data is missing or no data were collected.

By default the shape of a raster is always rectangular. So if we have  a dataset
that has a shape that isn't rectangular, some pixels at the edge of the raster
will have `NoDataValue`s. This often happens when the data were collected by an
airplane which only flew over some part of a defined region.

In the image below, the pixels that are black have `NoDataValue`s. The camera
did not collect data in these areas.

```{r demonstrate-no-data-black-ggplot, echo=FALSE}
# Below is for the purpose of plotting to demonstrated missing values, don't worry about the code
# Use stack function to read in all bands
RGB_stack <-
  rast("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")

# aggregate cells from 0.25m to 2m for plotting to speed up the lesson and
# save memory
RGB_2m <- raster::aggregate(RGB_stack, fact = 8, fun = median)
# fix data values back to integer datatype

# convert to a df for plotting using raster's built-in method
RGB_2m_df  <- as.data.frame(RGB_2m, xy = TRUE)
# make colnames easy to ref
names(RGB_2m_df) <- c('x', 'y', 'red', 'green', 'blue')

In the next image, the black edges have been assigned `NoDataValue`. R doesn't
render pixels that contain a specified `NoDataValue`. R assigns missing data
with the `NoDataValue` as `NA`.

The difference here shows up as ragged edges on the plot, rather than black
spaces where there is no data.

```{r demonstrate-no-data-ggplot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# demonstration code - not being taught
RGB_2m_df_nd <- RGB_2m_df
# convert the three rgb values to hex codes
RGB_2m_df_nd$hex <- rgb(RGB_2m_df_nd$red,
                        RGB_2m_df_nd$green,
                        RGB_2m_df_nd$blue, maxColorValue = 255)
# set black hex code to NA
RGB_2m_df_nd$hex[RGB_2m_df_nd$hex == '#000000'] <- NA_character_

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = RGB_2m_df_nd, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = hex)) +
  scale_fill_identity() +
  ggtitle("Orthographic Imagery", subtitle = "All bands")

```

If your raster already has `NA` values set correctly but you aren't sure where 
they are, you can deliberately plot them in a particular colour. This can be 
useful when checking a dataset's coverage. For instance, sometimes data can be 
missing where a sensor could not 'see' its target data, and you may wish to 
locate that missing data and fill it in.

To highlight `NA` values in ggplot, alter the `scale_fill_*()` layer to contain 
a colour instruction for `NA` values, like `scale_fill_viridis_c(na.value = 'deeppink')`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# demonstration code
# function to replace 0 with NA where all three values are 0 only
RGB_2m_nas <- app(RGB_2m, 
                  fun = function(x) {
                    if (sum(x == 0, na.rm = TRUE) == length(x))
                       return(rep(NA, times = length(x)))
                    x
                  })
RGB_2m_nas <- as.data.frame(RGB_2m_nas, xy = TRUE, na.rm = FALSE)

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = RGB_2m_nas, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_RGB_Ortho_3)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = 'grey90', high = 'blue', na.value = 'deeppink') +
  ggtitle("Orthographic Imagery", subtitle = "Blue band, with NA highlighted") 

# memory saving
rm(RGB_2m, RGB_stack, RGB_2m_df_nd, RGB_2m_df, RGB_2m_nas)
```

The value that is conventionally used to take note of missing data (the
`NoDataValue` value) varies by the raster data type. For floating-point rasters,
the figure `-3.4e+38` is a common default, and for integers, `-9999` is
common. Some disciplines have specific conventions that vary from these
common values.

In some cases, other `NA` values may be more appropriate. An `NA` value should
be a) outside the range of valid values, and b) a value that fits the data type
in use. For instance, if your data ranges continuously from -20 to 100, 0 is
not an acceptable `NA` value! Or, for categories that number 1-15, 0 might be
fine for `NA`, but using -.000003 will force you to save the GeoTIFF on disk
as a floating point raster, resulting in a bigger file.

If we are lucky, our GeoTIFF file has a tag that tells us what is the
`NoDataValue`. If we are less lucky, we can find that information in the
raster's metadata. If a `NoDataValue` was stored in the GeoTIFF tag, when R
opens up the raster, it will assign each instance of the value to `NA`. Values
of `NA` will be ignored by R as demonstrated above.


## How to find the values for "no data"

We can use the output from the `describe()` and `sources()` functions to find out what 
`NoDataValue` is used for our `DSM_HARV` dataset.

```{r}
describe(sources(DSM_HARV))
```

`NoDataValue` are encoded as -9999.

## Bad Data Values in Rasters

Bad data values are different from `NoDataValue`s. Bad data values are values
that fall outside of the applicable range of a dataset.

Examples of Bad Data Values:

- The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is a measure of
  greenness, has a valid range of -1 to 1. Any value outside of that range would
  be considered a "bad" or miscalculated value.
- Reflectance data in an image will often range from 0-1 or 0-10,000 depending
  upon how the data are scaled. Thus a value greater than 1 or greater than 10,000
  is likely caused by an error in either data collection or processing.

### Find Bad Data Values

Sometimes a raster's metadata will tell us the range of expected values for a
raster. Values outside of this range are suspect and we need to consider that
when we analyze the data. Sometimes, we need to use some common sense and
scientific insight as we examine the data - just as we would for field data to
identify questionable values.

Plotting data with appropriate highlighting can help reveal patterns in bad
values and may suggest a solution. Below, reclassification is used to highlight
elevation values over 400m with a contrasting colour.

```{r demo-bad-data-highlighting, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# reclassify raster to ok/not ok
DSM_highvals <- classify(DSM_HARV, 
                         rcl = matrix(c(0, 400, NA_integer_, 400, 420, 1L), 
                                      ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE), 
                         include.lowest = TRUE)
DSM_highvals <- as.data.frame(DSM_highvals, xy = TRUE)

DSM_highvals <- DSM_highvals[!is.na(DSM_highvals$HARV_dsmCrop), ]

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = DSM_HARV_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_dsmCrop)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  # use reclassified raster data as an annotation
  annotate(geom = 'raster', x = DSM_highvals$x, y = DSM_highvals$y, 
           fill = scales::colour_ramp('deeppink')(DSM_highvals$HARV_dsmCrop)) +
  ggtitle("Elevation Data", subtitle = "Highlighting values > 400m") 

# memory saving
rm(DSM_highvals)
```

## Create A Histogram of Raster Values

We can explore the distribution of values contained within our raster using the
`geom_histogram()` function which produces a histogram. Histograms are often
useful in identifying outliers and bad data values in our raster data.

```{r view-raster-histogram2}
ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(data = DSM_HARV_df, aes(HARV_dsmCrop), bins = 40)

```
